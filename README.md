# ZKP-Data-Quality

The largely untapped power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) have many compelling use cases.  

ZKP-Data-Quality provides an approach for a trustless proof of dataset-quality ensuring integrity and privacy.  
As such, multiple parties wishing to collaborate may proove that a given dataset meets certain qualitative criteria at a given time and without revealing the actual data. 

This approach allows for more streamlined and reliable working practices within organisations and externally. Sharing datasets safely and reliably facilitates new opportunities and greater business value. In addition, adherence to regulation could be more easily facilitated, for example, if datasets used in medical trials or financial reporting could be verified as meeting criteria thresholds at the time of use.

## Project Overview

The first objective is to process a dataset by computing cryptographic hashes for each row and then construct Merkle Trees to represent both the original and sorted datasets. 
The original dataset is sorted outside of the proof for more efficient circuit computation. However, a proof of provenance is created to ensure that both the sorted and unsorted versions of the dataset can be traced back to the original dataset. This avoids any chance of data quality claims being attributed to the wrong dataset.

The second objective is to generate and verify ZKPs to confirm a given quality aspect, all without exposing the underlying data. There are various data quality aspects such as row-uniqueness or row-completeness that proofs can be generated for and these aspects can be seen as subfolders under the lib/ folder.  

## Features

- **Data Hashing:** Utilizes cryptographic hash functions to represent data entries securely.
- **Merkle Tree Construction:** Builds Merkle Trees for both original and sorted datasets to facilitate efficient and secure data verification.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation:** Generates proofs to verify data properties without revealing the data itself.
- **Proof Verification:** Verifies the generated proofs to ensure data integrity and correctness.

## Installation

You can set up the project natively or more easily using docker.

### 1. Native Installation
To run the project natively without Docker, follow these steps to install the necessary software dependencies:

- Node.js + npm
- Rust and Cargo 
- Circom

The project package.json file contains the npm installed dependencies.

  "dependencies": {
    "circomlib": "^2.0.5",
    "circomlibjs": "^0.1.7",
    "crypto": "^1.0.1",
    "crypto-browserify": "^3.12.1",
    "csv-parser": "^3.0.0",
    "snarkjs": "^0.7.4"
  }

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   
   Ensure that Node.js (version 20 or higher) and npm are installed on your system.  
   You can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   
   To verify the installation, run:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

1. **Install Python 3 and Pip:**

   Some scripts may require Python 3. Install Python 3 and its package manager, pip, from the official Python website.

   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

1. **Install Rust and Cargo:**

   The project requires Rust and its package manager, Cargo. Install them using rustup.
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   
   After installation, adding cargo to the PATH in ~/.bash_profile and then source the fileto apply.
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

1. **Install Circom:**

   Circom is a circuit compiler for zkSNARKs. Clone the Circom repository and build it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
   cd circom
   cargo build --release
   cargo install --path circom
   ```

   After installation, verify by running:
   ```bash
   circom --version
   ```

1. **Install SnarkJS:**

   SnarkJS is a JavaScript library for zkSNARKs. Install it globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g snarkjs
   ```
   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   snarkjs --version
   ```

1. **Install Additional Node.js Packages:**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages listed in package.json.
   ```bash
   cd zkp-data-quality
   npm install
   ```
   This command installs the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

By completing these steps, you will have all the necessary software dependencies installed to run the project natively on your system.


### 2. Installation Using Docker

To streamline the setup process, you can utilize Docker to run the project without installing Node.js or npm locally. 
The Docker container has all the software dependencies and mounts the host machine to access the project code. 
See the Dockerfile and entrypoint.sh files for more details.  

1. **Install Docker:**

   If not already installed, you can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

2. **Pull or build the Docker Image:**

   To retrieve the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   docker pull namenottaken/zkp-environment:latest
   ```

   To build the Dockerfile locally and list it:

   ```bash
   cd zkp-data-quality
   docker build -t namenottaken/zkp-environment:latest .
   docker images
   ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the project repo:**

   For both native and docker usage, clone this project and enter the folder.  
   In addition retrieve the powers-of-tau files used in the zksnark setup ceremony.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jondowson/zkp-data-quality.git
   cd zkp-data-quality
   mkdir ptau
   wget -P ptau/ https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_16.ptau
   wget -P ptau/ https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_22.ptau
   ```

1. **Run the application:**

   Each subfolder of the lib folder creates a proof for a certain dataset attribute, e.g. uniqueness of rows.  
   See the lib folder to see all available proofs.

   To run natively use this command:

   ```bash
   node lib/<lib_folder>/main.js <lib_folder>/your_dataset.csv
   // Example:
   node lib/unique_rows/main.js unique_rows/d100.csv
   ```
   
   To run as a docker container use this command:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app namenottaken/zkp-environment:latest <lib_folder> <data_file>
   // Example - note that main.js is assumed for the first passed parameter.
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app namenottaken/zkp-environment:latest unique_rows unique_rows/d100.csv
   ```
